# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates
Use sample AWS CloudFormation templates to learn how to declare specific AWS resources or solve a particular use case. We recommend that you use sample templates as a starting point for creating your own templates, not for launching production-level environments. Before launching a template, always review the resources that it will create and the permissions it requires.

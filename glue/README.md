Simple, flexible and cost-effective ETL service.
AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analysis purposes. You can create and execute ETL jobs with a few mouse clicks in the AWS Management Console. By simply pointing AWS Glue to your data stored in AWS, the application recognizes your data and stores the associated metadata (such as table definitions and schemas) in the AWS Glue data catalog. You can browse, query and use your data for ETL immediately after cataloging. AWS Glue generates the code to perform data transformations and load your data.
You have the possibility to adapt, reuse and port the code generated by AWS Glue. Once your ETL job is ready, you can schedule its execution within AWS Glue's fully managed, scaled Apache Spark environment. AWS Glue provides a flexible planning tool with dependency resolution, job monitoring, and notification.
Because AWS Glue is serverless, there is no need to purchase, deploy, and manage infrastructure. AWS Glue automatically provides the environment required for the job. Customers pay only for the computing resources used to execute ETL jobs. With AWS Glue, data can be delivered for analysis in minutes.
